Start a server with sudo service mongod start
//Leave this tab alone, it needs to be running so that we can interact
// with the database




//In mongodb, we want to use
	{$set: {object}}, if we want to update, but not completely overwrite the 
	object
	
	To completely overwrite, we just pass in another object

Basic mongoDB commands
	mongod
	mongo
	help
	show dbs
	use
	insert
	find
	update
	remove
